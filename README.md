##Technical Approach

Informatix Inc. is a minority-owned, Sacramento-based technology company that has provided information technology solutions and services to government and private industry for 30 years.   Our response team for the Pre-Qualified Vendor Pool for Digital Services – Agile Development RFI utilized an agile human centered approach to create our ADPQ prototype. We focused on the needs of the end users which drove our feature development and our application program interfaces (API) integration. We started with a discovery that included surveys, research, and interviews and focus groups with users which was conducted continuously throughout the iterations. This continuous feedback promoted end user adoption and satisfaction 

Our team used the following user centric processes to complete this prototype:

* Conducted [surveys]() of the home page immediately following the start of the project.
* Conducted research to understand the trends within the industry and other State solutions.
* Created [personas]() to identify, personalize and focus on end users’ needs.
* Developed [user stories]() and created backlog.
* Developed front end UI web/mobile application. Conducted usability testing and improvements were
incorporated into the design and user stories.  The results of the first usability test results are [here]().
* Developed functioning UI web/mobile application. Conducted additional [usability testing]();  
improvements were incorporated into the user stories and final design.
* Developed fully functioning prototype including backend API and conducted another cycle of [usability testing](). Results were evaluated and either (1) prioritized and incorporated into the user stories and the final design of the prototype,
or (2) identified as future improvements to the prototype. 


We started each iteration with a sprint planning meeting. These meetings were time-boxed conversations, where our Product Manager and the team identified which stories to be worked on for that sprint. Our Product Manager prioritized and added the stories to the sprint backlog. We conducted daily, in person, scrum meetings to discuss the progress that was made since the last scrum meeting (“yesterday”), goals to accomplish before the next scrum meeting (“tomorrow”), and any impediments that were preventing team members from performing their work. We conducted whiteboard sessions, initial wireframes and mockups immediately after the project start date, so we could immediately start surveying end users and have an initial mock up in hand. We conducted whiteboard sessions, additional design sessions, made continuous updates to wireframes and mockups throughout the effort.  We performed testing and made adjustments based on issues and feedback from our test cycles and usability tests. Each of our sprint cycles was performed to ensure that the prototype functioned and met user requirements.

###CalNotify Architecture|
Cal Notify is built using a three tier [architecture]() consisting of a client side, single-page web application, a RESTful web API providing backend application services and a database tier for storing application data and state.

###Code Flow
Our code flow illustrating application layers and technologies used is indicated below; our software architecture which  
illustrates code flow can be found [here]().

###Adherence to the US Digital Services Playbook 
We followed all of the applicable Playbook plays.  Our agile human centered approach incorporates the application development aspects
of the U.S. Digital Services Playbook.  Details can be found [here]().

###User Centric Design 

>c.Understood what people needed 

Human centered design focuses on improving the user experience – a goal that is impossible to achieve without understanding what people need.  Our [human centered design approach]() has three phases: Discovery, Ideation and Implementation.  Each phase has specific activities focused on eliciting user needs.
* Discovery – Our Interaction Designer, Architect, Business Analysts, Delivery Manager, and Product Manager developed concepts for discussion and iteration including the following activities:  
  - Developed [personas]() that represented California residents, the intended users of this application.  
  - Designed a mockup of homepage for the application to use as a springboard for user persona interviews and surveys.  
  -	Conducted surveys and interviews to obtain feedback on the homepage, eliciting user expectations regarding log-in,  
  account formation, notification preferences, and general expectations regarding the functionality of the application.  
  
* Ideation – during this phase, our team refined our conceptual understanding of user requirements, by completing the following:  
  - Conducted [whiteboard sessions]() to review user feedback and expectations.
  - Created initial [user stories]() reflecting each persona and their requirements.  
  - Established a product backlog used for Sprint planning.
  - Utilized a Sprint Backlog for subsequent sprints.  
  - Developed [wireframes]() based on whiteboard sessions and user stories.
  - Developed a [template]() to facilitate usability testing, and conducted Usability Testing with users and held one-on-one interviews,     to review wireframes and elicit feedback.  
  - Developed mockups based on wireframes and results of Usability Testing.
  - Conducted additional [Usability Testing]() for mock-ups. 
  - Developed final user stories based on results of Usability Testing. 
  - Create our [style guide]() and established design philosophy based on user feedback.

* Implementation – our team’s implementation efforts included the following  
  - Began our first sprint cycle
  - Conduct Sprint Planning to commit to user stories to develop in the sprint
  - Conducted daily scrum meetings 
  - Developed first iteration of Cal Notify
  - Conducted [Usability Testing]() to elicit user feedback 
  - Refined user stories and product backlog based on user feedback  
  - Conducted Quality Assurance and [Accessibility Testing]() with defect resolution as necessary.
  - Conduct Sprint Review meeting to demo completed software and to elicit acceptance/changes from stakeholders 
  - Initiated subsequent sprint cycles including scrum meetings, usability testing, quality assurance and accessibility testing,  
    and defect resolution  
  - Released Informatix’ Cal Notify solution
