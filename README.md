##**Technical Approach**

Informatix Inc. is a minority-owned, Sacramento-based technology company that has provided information technology solutions
and services to government and private industry for 30 years. Our response team for the Pre-Qualified Vendor Pool for
Digital Services – Agile Development RFI utilized an agile human centered approach to create our ADPQ prototype. We focused 
on the needs of the end users which drove our feature development and our application program interfaces (API) integration.
We started with a discovery that included surveys, research, and interviews and focus groups with users which was conducted  continuously throughout the iterations. This continuous feedback promoted end user adoption and satisfaction. 

Our team used the following user centric processes to complete this prototype:
* Conducted [surveys]() of the home page immediately following the start of the project
* Conducted research to understand the trends within the industry and other State solutions
* Created [personas]() to identify, personalize and focus on end users’ needs
* Developed [user stories]() and created backlog
* Developed front end UI web/mobile application. Conducted usability testing and improvements were incorporated into
the design and user stories. The first usability test results are [here.]()
* Developed functioning UI web/mobile application. Conducted quantitative and qualitative usability testing and improvements were incorporated into the user stories and final design
* Developed fully functioning prototype including backend API. Conducted quantitative and qualitative usability testing and prioritized improvements which were incorporated into the user stories, final design or identified as additional improvements if prototype future improvements

We started each iteration with a sprint planning meeting. These meetings were time-boxed conversations, where our Product Manager and the team identified which stories to be worked on for that sprint. Our Product Manager prioritized and added the stories to the sprint backlog. We conducted daily, in person, scrum meetings to discuss the progress that was made since the last scrum meeting ('yesterday'), goals to accomplish before the next scrum meeting ('tomorrow'), and any impediments that were preventing team members from performing their work. We conducted whiteboard sessions, initial wireframes and mockups immediately after the project start date, so we could immediately start surveying end users and have an initial mock up in hand. We conducted whiteboard sessions, additional design sessions, made continuous updates to wireframes and mockups throughout the effort.  We performed testing and made adjustments based on issues and feedback from our test cycles and usability tests. Each of our sprint cycles was performed to ensure that the prototype functioned and met user requirements.
