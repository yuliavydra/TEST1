## Technical Approach
>

##Team
>a.Assigned one (1) leader and gave that person authority and responsibility and held that
person accountable for the quality of the prototype submitted

We identified Caroline Brown-Pierce to be our Product Manager and Product Owner.  
She was given authority to make final decisions on concept, design and functionality. 

>b.Assembled a multidisciplinary and collaborative team that includes, at a minimum, five (5) of the labor  
categories as identified in Attachment B: PQVP DS-AD Labor Category Descriptions

We assembled a very talented team of experienced and creative professionals using eleven labor categories  
identified in the RFI: 

1.  Product Manager: Caroline Brown-Pierce  
2.  Technical Architect: Paul Ortiz  
3.  Interaction Design/User Researcher/Usability Tester - Lesa Jones  
4.  Writer/Content Designer/ Content Strategist: Yulia Vydra  
5.  Visual Designer:  Nirali Tank  
6.  Front End Web Developer: Sean Kammerich  
7.  Security Engineer: Sean Kammerich  
8.  Backend  Web Developers: Sean Kammerich, Nirali Tank  
9.  DevOps Engineer: Paul Ortiz  
10. Delivery Manager: Lesa Jones  
11. Business Analysts: Stephany Jones, Ian Toner, Luis Pelayo  

##Design
>c. Understood what people needed, by including people in the prototype development and design process
To understand what people need our team of business analysts has interviewed people outside the company as well as those working in  
the company and not in any way aware or related to the project. The responses that were received were thereafter thoroughly analyzed. This analysis leads to understanding what type of information and in which form will be most valuable for the user and how properly structure of email, SMS and Push Notifications from authorized users. It is also helped us to understand radius and area of coverage  
to be included based on address registered by user.

>d.d. Used at least a minimum of three (3) “user-centric design” techniques and/or tools

To create “user-centric” design we:
-Asked random people in the lobby of our building and in the nearest Starbucks coffee shop to evaluate clearness and  
intuitively of 10 screen shots that included login page and profile settings page. The feedback we received led to creation  
of dashboard and re-structuring of landing page.
-We iterate this process by showing re-modeled pages to people in the office that have not seen any of the pages before.
-We conducted on site testing by inviting people of different backgrounds and occupations to give us feedback for usability.
